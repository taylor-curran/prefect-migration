## Important things to keep in mind:

The main requirment for Prefect is the @flow decorator. Tasks (@task) is optional but recommended.

The point being when converting a script to a prefect flow, you should start with the flow first, check that that works, then add in tasks where appropriate.

This is a large paradigm shift from Airflow where you have a DAG object with tasks and all of that is required to even run.

Prefect can run any valid python function or method provided it has at least an @flow decorator.

Prefect can also run flows locally. You can invoke flows to run locally just like you would invoke a python function. Just call the flow decoratored function and you'll get a local instance of a flow run.


### 1. Audit & Prioritize 

 
- **Catalog DAGs** : list all `*.py` DAG definitions.
 
- **Tag high‑impact & high‑change** : migrate small, simple DAGs first as proof‑of‑concept.


### 2. Prefect Environment Setup 

 
- **Install Prefect** : `pip install prefect`
 
- **Parallel Runtime** : run Prefect alongside Airflow (local/Docker/K8s) to test without disruption.


### 3. Incremental Cutover 

 
- **One pipeline at a time** : deploy each Prefect flow, validate it, then deprecate its Airflow DAG.
 
- **Avoid dual maintenance** : stop running the Airflow DAG as soon as its Prefect replacement is stable.
 
- **Unified alerts** : use Airflow alerts for remaining DAGs and Prefect notifications for new flows.


### 4. Code Translation Patterns 

| Airflow Concept | Prefect Equivalent | Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  DAG object + with DAG(...) |  @flow‑decorated Python function | Flows are just functions; call them directly. | 
|  PythonOperator / BashOperator |  @task‑decorated Python function | No boilerplate operators—any code is a task. | 
|  XCom pushes/pulls |  Direct return values | Downstream tasks receive outputs as function arguments. | 
|  Schedule in code |  Schedule on deployment | Define schedule via CLI/UI; keep code separate from cron. | 
|  Retries in DAG/task args |  @flow(retries=…) / @task(retries=…) | Specify retry policies in decorators. | 

**Minimal Conversion Template** 


```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def extract_data():
    # your extract logic
    return [...]

@task
def transform_data(data):
    # your transform logic
    return [...]

@task
def load_data(data):
    # your load logic

@flow(name="etl_pipeline", retries=1)
def etl_pipeline():
    raw = extract_data()
    processed = transform_data(raw)
    load_data(processed)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    etl_pipeline()
```


### 5. Infrastructure Mapping 

| Airflow Executor | Prefect Work Pool / Runner | 
| --- | --- | 
| LocalExecutor | Local Work Pool + ConcurrentTaskRunner | 
| CeleryExecutor | Multi‑node Workers (process/docker pools) | 
| KubernetesExecutor | Kubernetes Work Pool (pods per run) | 
| SSH/BashOperators | @task with Paramiko / shell calls | 

 
- **Define work pools**  via CLI/UI, keep deployment config separate from code.

**Next Steps for Your AI Agent** 
 
2. **Scan repo**  for `with DAG` blocks and extract task/operator definitions.
 
4. **Generate**  Prefect flow and task stubs using the template above.
 
6. **Replace**  XCom pushes/pulls with direct function returns/calls.
 
8. **Output**  a mapping report: Airflow DAG name → Prefect flow name & file.


This distilled checklist equips your agent to automate the conversion of Airflow DAGs into Prefect flows.
